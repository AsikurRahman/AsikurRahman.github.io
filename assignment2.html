          Instructions: Create a schematic for at least 3 LEDs connected to your Arduino,
          which you will implement as a circuit on your breadboard. You will write
          firmware (in a .ino file) for the circuit that makes the LEDs blink in a pattern.

          This is a schematic going into more details about the different parts within the circuit. I went ahead and created 3 different circuits where each had their own set of resistors and LED. I created multiple circuits in order to prevent any overload issues with the LED or resistor.

          Code Snippet:

          </p>

          This code allows each of the led lights to be individually programmable, and therefore each LED light can blink independently.
