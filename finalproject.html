          <h1>Final Project: A Lot of Fade!</h1>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>

          A row of 6 LED lights that initially turns on one by one in a loop forever until you press a button that allows you to produce a slow light fade interaction to all of the LED lights.

        Further Technical Implementation Details
        </p>

      </p>

As for the technical implementation details, I have a input pin that is connected to the number 7 and this is used to read if current is being supplied from the 5V when I press a button, if the input pin reads current passing through then the button gate will close and supply the current to all the other output pins and execute the fade pattern code I wrote to the following output pins-- 3,5,6,9,10, 11. Each of these output pins have either a blue or red LED light and a 220 resistor. 220 resistor was chosen because this resistor was appropriate to still let the LED work while accounting for itâ€™s voltage drop. 
      </p>

          </p>

          Code Snippet:

        </p>

        The key to being able to have 6 LED lights working on the breadboard was making sure I initialize 6 output pins. I also initialized a input pin to help read when the button was pushed and execute the code I wrote to produce the fading light pattern. The initial behavior of the LED lights is the lights turning on and then having a 100ms delay and then turning off and having a 100 ms delay after that.

        </p>

          </p>

          </p>

When the button is pressed, I have code written that allows all the LEDS at the same time to show a slow fading pattern. When the button is pressed, analogWrite is used to write the brightness values from 255 to 0 during a duration of 3ms.
